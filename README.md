### 📌 Overview

This Power BI project visualizes and analyzes hotel booking data to uncover customer behavior, revenue trends, destination popularity, and more. The goal is to assist stakeholders in making data-driven decisions in the hospitality industry. 

### 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

 **Power BI Desktop:** Used mainly for the creation and visualization of this report.
 
 **DAX for Calculations:** Used for creating calculated measures and Calendar Date table.
 
 **Power Query for Data Transformation:** Used for data transformation and creating new columns instead of using calculated columns, which would be a burden on the computer's memory, especially if the dataset was large.
 
 **Data Modeling:** Use for establishing relationships between the main dataset and Calendar Date table.
